# Welcome!
We are excited to create awesome stuff with you. Members of this team are focused and engaged, working towards a common goal with shared values, complementary skill-sets, and open communication. Here, no question is off-limits.  Do not be afraid to ask if you are unsure of something. The only wrong question is the question not asked.

# Developer Guide

### Core Principles
1. Make it Beautiful
2. Make it Useful
3. Make it Fun

### Best Practices
1. Keep Scope Tight.  Global Variables to a Minimum
2. Write Comments on your code often.  You are working with others.
3. Use abstraction to build easy-to-read reusable functions/components ( countToThree(), clearList(), filterUsers() )
4. Triple Check code that deals directly with the database. Use a service like Postman to verify your APIs are functioning as you expect before connecting them up to the live database.
5. Keep the responsibilities of the code separate. Don't mix multiple tasks on one file.
6. Use pull requests.  Do not commit to the main branch unless you are explicitly instructed to.

### Convention
When to use camelCase:
- naming functions

When to use CapitalCase:
- naming screens


Let's make something great!
